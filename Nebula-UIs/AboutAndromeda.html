        <h1>Andromeda</h1>
        
        <p>
            <a href="andromeda.html">Andromeda</a> is a visual analytics system
            that supports exploratory analyses of high-dimensional data. Originally,
            it was developed by Jessica Self as a Java application; the version
            you see hosted here is a "webified" version of her tool that has since
            been expanded upon by Ming Wang to incorporate additional visual aids
            and altering the algorithm to make the system more intuitive to novice
            users.

        <p>
            In summary, Andromeda uses Weighted Multidimensional Scaling (WMDS)
            to create a scatterplot-like visualization of high-dimensional data
            using a "near == similar" metaphor, meaning the closer together two
            data items are projected, the more similar they are. This projection
            can then be interacted with in two ways: a parametric interaction (PaI)
            or projection-level interaction (PrI; previously termed observation-level
            interaction or OLI). With a parametric interaction, the user can
            interact with the slider bars to the right of the projection to
            manipulate the weights assigned to each attribute in the dataset. These
            weights are then used to reproject the data items accordingly, thereby
            enabling the user to explore alternate projections and different
            definitions of "similarity."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In contrast, a projection-level interaction enables the user to directly
            and intuitively express desired similarity relationships between data
            items by dragging the data items to reflect their desired similarities/dissimilarities.
            After clicking "Update Layout," Andromeda uses an "inverse WMDS"
            algorithm to determine what the attribute weights should be given the
            user-defined coordinates of the data items they interacted with. No
            other data items are used in this calculation, regardless of where they
            are in relation to the data items that were interacted with. Given
            the nature of this algorithm, at least 3 data items must be interacted
            with in order to provide enough information to the inverse WMDS
            algorithm for it to learn these weights.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In its original implementation, PrI presented two main usability
            issues, particularly for novices: knowing which data items would be used
            in the inverse WMDS process and needing to interact with at least 3
            data items. These issues are summarized by what we call the "with
            respect to what" problem. In an attempt to help novice users with these
            issues, the original version of Andromeda highlighted interacted data
            items as well as performed automatic highlighting of additional data items
            within a given radius of the moved data item. As an exploration
            into how else we can help novices, the most recent version of Andromeda
            depicts how a data item that a user is moving relates to data items
            already selected for use in the inverse WMDS algorithm (as compared to
            their relationships prior to any selection/movement). Additionally,
            since many novices tend to want to only drag two data items
            together to denote a desired increase in their similarity (with
            respect to what their similarity was before the interaction), the
            inverse WMDS algorithm has been upgraded to randomly select
            additional data items to use in contrast with the user's selected
            data items. Other methods for enabling interaction with only two
            data items are being explored.
        </p>

            Andromeda has proven to be an incredibly useful system, whether to enable
            users explore data,
