        <h1>Cosmos</h1>
        
        <p>
            <a href="CosmosD3.html">Cosmos</a> is a visual analytics system
            to support exploration of large text datasets. This original version
            was developed by Michelle Dowling and Adam Binford to explore supporting
            text analytics by combining ideas from
            <a href="AboutAndromeda.html">Andromeda</a> with those from
            <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7042492?casa_token=JxxQ-5oaEi4AAAAA:ZSv_wgMwAcZLLStt-ETxmr_f9LQD7otgxNHA8gY5szTYjYgvIjtoXv_bgfP-C1_PVtPwuD6M6A">StarSPIRE</a>.
            Since then, many students and researchers have contributed
            to this project, culminating in CosmosOmniview (pictured and described
            below).
        </p>
        
        <img src="images/CosmosViewTopicNoLabels.png" alt="Cosmos screenshot" width="100%">

        <p>
            In the initial development of Cosmos, the goal was to take the
            visual "near = similar" metaphor from Andromeda with a multimodal
            pipeline structure similar to StarSPIRE, which enabled querying
            features. As such, this system enables projection-level interactions
            (like those in Andromeda) and document relevance interactions
            (similar to Andromeda's parametric interactions) while only showing
            the user the most relevant data to their investigation
            (similar to StarSPIRE). In so doing, users maintain an accurate sense
            of how similar the displayed documents are without being
            overwhelmed with the number of documents on the screen.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In conjunction with traditional keyword search foraging (i.e., using a search bar),
            Cosmos also uses automated foraging to show the user relevant
            documents based on how they interact with the system. As such, this
            automated foraging mechanism utilizes the same user interest model that
            is used by the projection algorithm to also drive the foraging algorithm.
            This new method for automated foraging is also used in
            <a href="AboutTwoView.html">Centaurus</a> and is currently under review.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After the <a href="CosmosD3.html">initial development of Cosmos</a>,
            the multimodal architecture enabled exploration into additional
            possibilities of combining existing research for the sake of an interactive
            "near == similar" visualization of text data that uses this automated
            foraging. These explorations include:

                to display documents and terms in the same, interactive
                projection. However, we found that this projection method often
                led to visualizations that seemed "polarized" based on the terms,
                meaning the perception of the similarity between documents was
                distorted. Ultimately, we decided that this distortion was too severe,
                often leading to the perception that documents hardly contained
                any similarities. This distortion is at least in part due to the
                sparse nature of the data (i.e., terms tend to not appear in many
                documents within a corpus). [Interactions with terms usually results
                in errors.]

                a center point, and the relevance as both the node size and the
                node's distance from the center point. [Our algorithm used to
                process the projection-level interactions does not work fully as
                intended, but this version of Cosmos still serves as a useful and

                this version uses an interactive topic model, which enables interaction
                with even larger datasets. The topic model has information
