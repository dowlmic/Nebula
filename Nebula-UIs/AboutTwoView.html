        <h1>SIRIUS and Centaurus</h1>
        
        <p>
            <a href="SIRIUS.html">SIRIUS</a> and <a href="Centaurus.html">Centaurus</a>
            are both visualizations for high-dimensional data that are similar
            in nature to <a href="AboutCosmos.html">Cosmos</a>, with the exception
            that there are now two visualizations: one for the data items and
            one for their attributes. Using the "Provide Feedback After Interaction"
            checkbox beneath a given projection allows the given visualization to
            "receive information" from the other visualization. For example,
            if the checkbox is checked under the data item visualization, then
            performing an interaction in that visualization will result in the
            corresponding change that will occur in the attribute visualization
            to affect the final appearance of the data item visualization.
            In addition to this interactivity, Centaurus also enables foraging.
            In other words, SIRIUS displays all data by default (like
            <a href="AboutAndromeda.html">Andromeda</a> does), whereas Centaurus
            enables both traditional keyword search foraging and automated foraging
            (similar to Cosmos).

            Ultimately, the interactivity between these visualizations is enabled
            using dot products between weight vectors and normalized raw data.
            Initially, these weight vectors are used as they are in
            Andromeda, which allow for each visualization of high-dimensional
            data to be individually interactive. As such, the data item
            visualization uses attribute weights, and the attribute visualization
            uses data item weights. After a parametric interaction or a
            projection-level interaction (as described in the Andromeda link above),
            one of these weight vectors is redefined. Using a dot product with
            normalized data, we are able to use this weight vector to produce the
            other weight vector.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a more concrete example, let's say the user performs a parametric
            interaction with an attribute. The user-defined weight is then used
            in the the attribute weights, changing this weight vector. By using a
            dot product between this weight vector and the normalized data for
            the data items, we are able to compute a new set of weights for each
            data item. As a final step to enable richer insights into correlations
            within the dataset, we perform a similar dot product between these
            new data item weights and the normalized data for the attributes to
            produce a final set of attribute weights.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A similar process is used for projection-level interactions. If the
            user performs such an interaction in the attribute visualization
            (to reflect desired similarity/dissimilarity relationships between
            attributes), then a new set of data item weights is computed (such that
            these weights would produce a visualization that captured the user-defined
            relationships). These data item weights are then used in a dot product
            with the normalized attribute data to produce a new set of attribute
            weights.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Centaurus takes this concept a step further by utilizing these weight
            vectors as a ranking metric on previously unseen data items and
            attributes to perform automated foraging. Thus, like in Cosmos,
            this automated foraging uses the same user interest models used by the projections to
            automatically add more information to the screen. This new method for
            automated foraging is currently under review.
